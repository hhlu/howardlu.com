<h1>Hi, I'm Howard ...</h1>

<p class="lead"><img src="/images/photo.jpg" alt="Howard Lu" class="img pull-right" /> ... and I'd like to share my thoughts and experiences as an early career software developer.</p>

<p>I hold a B.Sc in Computer Science and have been at a few companies so far in my career. If I had to point out one thing
my positions had in common, it would be the huge amounts of knowledge I picked up working in them. Combined with what I manage
to pick up in my spare time, I began to feel a need to write the information down.</p>

<p>On this site you'll find tutorials, explanations and opinions on various technical topics I have experience with
as well as new ones as I learn them. There may be a few projects here and there too. If this interests you, head over
and check out my <a href="/">blog posts</a>. If not, <a href="/contact/">let me know</a> what would and I'll see if I can do
something about it for your next visit.</p>
